# Overview

This is my, Alan Cinsavich's, Flatiron Software Engineering Flex Program's Phase 1 project: A wiki page that is an auto biography of sorts of how I started my previous career of photography.

On the main body of the webpage I tell the story of how I started in photography from high school to the present.

I was going to use a manually built json database but for the sake of smiplicity and expediency I decided to use the tried and true method that was already recommended by signing up for an API key from Pixabay.

# Deliverables

1. Using the PixaBay API, my site will fetch images of hot rod cars and beautiful female models as examples of my early photo work. Disclaimer: Images are NOT MINE.

2. The user can "like" images.

3. The user can input their contact info into a subscribe form.

4. Once the user inputs their contact info they can subscribe to the webpage.
