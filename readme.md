# Overview

This is my, Alan Cinsavich's, Flatiron Software Engineering Flex Program's Phase 1 project: A wiki page that is an auto biography of sorts of how I started my previous career of photography.

On the main body of the webpage I tell the story of how I started in photography from high school to the present.

I also built photo database as a JSON database to put my early photo work in so I can display those images on my webpage as galleries.
