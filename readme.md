# Overview

This is my, Alan Cinsavich's, Flatiron Software Engineering Flex Program's Phase 1 project: A wiki page that is an auto biography of sorts of how I started my previous career of photography.

On the main body of the webpage I tell the story of how I started in photography from high school to the present.

I also built photo database as a JSON database to put my early photo work in so I can display those images on my webpage as galleries.

# Deliverables

1. The user is able to change the photo displayed in each gallery one a time by clicking the button 'change photo'.

2. ???? The user can "like" images. ????

3. The user can input their contact info into a subscribe form.

4. Once the user inputs their contact info they can subscribe to the webpage.
